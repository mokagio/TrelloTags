###Usage

To add a tag to your Trello card, add it to the title wrapped by { }. That's all.

####Usage with TrelloScrum

If you're using TrelloTags together with [TrelloScrum](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jdbcdblgjdpmfninkoogcfpnkjmndgje?hl=en-US&hc=search&hcp=main) you should add the tags **at the end** of the title, to avoid clashing with the card points.
